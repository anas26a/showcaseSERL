Here's an enhanced version of your `README.md` to ensure that any user who clones your project will have all the information they need to run it successfully. I’ll also clarify instructions for dependencies, environment variables, and initial setup.

# ShowcaseSERL

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app). The project is designed to showcase projects in a portfolio-like display with features such as filtering, QR code generation, and kiosk mode.

## Project Structure

This project uses TypeScript, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS, among other dependencies. It also includes a `.gitignore` file, ensuring files like `node_modules`, environment files, and build artifacts aren’t included in the repository.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- **Node.js** (recommended version 14 or later)
- **npm** (or alternatively **yarn**, **pnpm**, or **bun**)

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/anas26a/showcaseSERL.git
   cd showcaseSERL
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   # or
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Environment Variables**:
   - Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory for environment variables. Example:
     ```
     NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=<your-api-url>
     ```
   - Replace `<your-api-url>` with your actual API endpoint or any other required environment variables.

4. **Run the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   # or
   pnpm dev
   # or
   bun dev
   ```

   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

5. **Edit Pages**:
   - Start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Features

This project includes:
- **Project Filtering**: Filter projects based on title, tags, and types.
- **QR Code Generation**: Each project detail page includes a QR code linking to it.
- **Kiosk Mode**: Auto-cycles through projects for public display.
- **Dark/Light Theme Toggle**: Customize the user experience with theme switching.

## Using Tailwind CSS

The project utilizes Tailwind CSS. Any custom styling or responsive design adjustments can be made in `tailwind.config.ts`.

## Testing

To run tests, use the following command:
```bash
npm test
```
